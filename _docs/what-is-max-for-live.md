## What Is Max For Live?
In this module, you will learn the visual programming language **Max For Live** (M4L) by building a number of devices that can be put to use in a Live session. Max is an enormous sand-box of a program with such a wide range of applications that it would be impossible to cover every detail of the 1000-odd objects and their possibilities from start to finish in a single course. The aim here is to provide you with the fundamentals of the application so that you can understand the key aspects of how Max works.

> Although the focus of this module is on **Max For Live**, some familiarity with Ableton Live will help greatly; it is recommended that you read the following information [https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/live-concepts/] to bring yourself up to speed.

The documentation that comes with Max is very detailed and provides clear examples of how the individual objects work, but at times the documentation can sometimes lack the context needed in order to fully understand how certain objects would tie in with your own ideas. By working through step-by-step examples in class and reverse engineering complete devices you will understand how the various objects and concepts within the programme work.  Some of the effects (referred to as ‘devices’ in M4L) covered in the module may be familiar, however, it is expected that students will be adding in more controls, features and flexibility than you may find in existing effects. Seeing how such effects are built will allow you start thinking about how you can expand one to meet your own needs.
