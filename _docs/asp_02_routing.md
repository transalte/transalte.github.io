# Routing

## Overview

| Object           | Desc. |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| selector~        |       |
| matrix~          |       |
| send/receive     |       |
| send~ / receive~ |       |


For a simple bypass between a dry and an affected signal, selector~ can be used to switch between the two signal streams:

### [selector~]

### matrix~

### send/receive

### send~/receive~
