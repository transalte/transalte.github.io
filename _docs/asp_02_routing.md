## Overview

| Object           | Desc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| selector~        | Use the selector~ object to choose between one of several input signals (or none). The selector~ is similar to the Max switch object but for signals, however if no input is chosen, it outputs a signal composed of zero values. |
| matrix~          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| send/receive     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| send~ / receive~ |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### [selector~]
For a simple bypass between a dry and an affected signal, selector~ can be used to switch between the two signal streams:
