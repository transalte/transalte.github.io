<p>This lesson is an introduction to building a basic monophonic subtractive synth. The fundamentals of a synth will be covered including MIDI data processing, oscillators, tuning and envelopes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2>

<p>The first step is to create a new <strong>Instrument Device</strong> in Live. The main difference between this template and a <strong>Audio Effect</strong> device is that in place of <code class="highlighter-rouge">plugin~</code> at the input stage there is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">midiin</code> object. This object passes through all of the MIDI data coming from Live into the device that will be utilised to control the patch.</p>

<p>The raw MIDI data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">midiin</code> contains a range of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note On/Off</li>
  <li>Velocity</li>
  <li>Poly Pressure</li>
  <li>Control change</li>
  <li>Programme change</li>
  <li>Aftertouch</li>
  <li>Pitchbend</li>
  <li>MIDI Channel</li>
</ul>

<p>To access these values individually, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">midiparse</code> object unpacks and converts the raw data into standard messages that can be utilised easily. The most commonly used parameters are Note-On/Off &amp; Velocity (for pitch and volume) and Control Change (for control of other parameters such as filters, effects and so on).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similar to the<sup id="fnref:exp"><a href="#fn:exp" class="footnote">1</a></sup> note information, Control Changes contain two elements; a controller number and the value. Dials, sliders and/or pads on a MIDI device will each be allocated a controller number and interacting with them will change the value (running from 0 to 127). These controllers can be mapped to different elements of a device, or DAW in Live’s case, i.e a filter, a delay’s feedback and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When pressing keys, MIDI information relating to the note(s) pressed is transmitted in two stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press key down on keyboard - transmits midi note number and how hard it was pressed.</li>
  <li>Release key on keyboard - transmits the same midi note again with a velocity of 0</li>
</ol>

<p>The patch below demonstrates how this information is generated from a key being pressed and released on a MIDI keyboard (or from a note drawn in to a clip in Live).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_03.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_03.png" alt="MIDI Information Parse" /><em>MIDI Information Parse</em></a></p>

<p>What do these numbers relate to?</p>

<p>Each key on the keyboard is allocated a number from 0 to 127:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MIDI Note 0 = C-1

MIDI Note 60 = C4 (Middle C)

MIDI Note 127 = G9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The velocity, calculated from how quickly the key is pressed down, is also given a value from 0 to 127.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="simple-monosynth">Simple Monosynth</h3>

<p>The patch below demonstrates an extremely basic monosynth using only the Note On/Off and Velocity data with the order of processing as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The midi information comes from <code class="highlighter-rouge">midiin</code></li>
  <li>The raw data is broken up via <code class="highlighter-rouge">midiparse</code></li>
  <li>The <strong>NoteOn/Off &amp; Velocity</strong> message pair is extracted and further broken down into midi note value and velocity value</li>
  <li>Velocity is converted from 0 to 127 to a linear amplitude between 0. and 1. through division by 127.</li>
  <li>The midi note value is converted into its correspoding pitch in Hz (via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtof</code> object)</li>
  <li>The pitch of the oscillator is changed by the value from <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtof</code></li>
  <li>The amplitude of the signal generated by <code class="highlighter-rouge">cycle~</code> is adjusted via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*~</code> object which is fed from the scaled velocity value</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_04.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_04.png" alt="Basic Monosynth" /><em>Basic Monosynth Patch</em></a></p>

<p>The functionality here is quite limited; the envelope of the sound is abruptly turned on and off with the amplitude of each note being controlled by the velocity data.</p>

<p>There are some playability issues with the patch as it is at the moment relating to how the patch copes with overlapping notes. This can be solved by introducing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ddg.mono</code> object which provides note priority handling:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_05.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_05.png" alt="Note Priority with ddg.mono" /><em>Note priority with ddg.mono</em></a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="envelopes">Envelopes</h2>
<p>The envelope of a sound is how it’s amplitude changes over time and is typically described via a the following stages; the attack, decay, sustain and release.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_06_env.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_06_env.png" alt="Standard ADSR Envelope" /><em>Standard ADSR Envelope</em></a></p>

<p>There are a number of ways to create an envelope in Max, each of varying levels of complexity and features. In this example, a standard Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release envelope will be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="linear-envelopes">Linear Envelopes</h3>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> object is an envelope generator. There are five inlets, the first is allocated to starting the envelope and to what peak amplitide it should go to - this will be fed from the velocity data in the patch. The remaining inlets are for the Attack and Decay times, the sustain level, and the releaes time.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_08_adsr01.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_08_adsr01.png" alt="adsr~ Object" /><em>adsr~ Object</em></a></p>

<p>The object shapes the volume of the sound as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘Note On’ occurs with velocity &gt; 0 (key pressed): The volume will swell over the attack time to reach the amplitide from velocity.</li>
  <li>With the key held the signal will drop down in amplitude to the sustain level (a fraction of the amplitude) over the decay time.</li>
  <li>When the key is released, the note is sent again with a velocity of 0 (closing the note) and the envelope amplitude will fall to 0 gain over the release time.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, the envelope would be a more percussive sound with no sustain. In the example below, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">scope~</code> object has been connected to the output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> to see the envelope generated:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_09_env.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_09_env.png" alt="adsr~ Envelope" /><em>adsr~ Envelope</em></a></p>

<h3 id="exponential-envelopes">Exponential Envelopes</h3>
<p>The output from <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> is linear by design i.e straight lines between the stages. Exponential envelopes, i.e curved, can sound more natural and are better for persussive sounds in particular:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_07_env.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_07_env.png" alt="Exponential ADSR Envelope" /><em>Exponential ADSR Envelope</em></a></p>

<p>A quick way to achieve this is to multiply the output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> envelope by itself<sup id="fnref:exp:1"><a href="#fn:exp" class="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_11_env.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_11_env.png" alt="Exponential adsr~ Envelope" /><em>Exponential adsr~ Envelope</em></a></p>

<p>Note the change in the curve of the envelopes. This curvature would also be present in the attack stages of the envelope too. In this example above, the output from the envelopes are multiplied by themselves to increase the curve of the envelope. This can be useful for transient based sounds such as percussion or plucked sounds.</p>

<h2 id="tuning-oscillators">Tuning Oscillators</h2>
<p>Tuning oscillators is generally kept to three areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Semi-tones</li>
  <li>Octaves</li>
  <li>De-tune (Hz)</li>
</ul>

<p>Semi-tones and Octaves can be adjusted by manipulating the MIDI note information directly, de-tuning can occur after the MIDI note has been converted to pitch.</p>

<h3 id="semi-tones">Semi-tones</h3>

<p>Semi-tone tuning can be achieved by simply adding or subtracting to the incoming MIDI note by the desired amount:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_16.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_16.png" alt="Semi-tone Tuning" /><em>Semi-tone Tuning</em></a></p>

<p>In the patch above, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">live.numbox</code> UI object has been used with a <em>Range/Enum</em> of <em>-12</em> to <em>12</em> to provide an octave up and down in semi-tones. The <em>Type</em> has been set to <em>Int</em> to avoid any fractional numbers being added which wouold confuse the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtof</code> object. The ‘st’, comes from the <em>Unit Style</em> being selected as ‘Semitones’ in the inspector.</p>

<h3 id="octaves">Octaves</h3>
<p>As an octave consists of 12 semi-tones, a simple multipier can be utilised:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_17.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_17.png" alt="Octave Tuning" /><em>Octave Tuning</em></a></p>

<p>In this case, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">live.numbox</code> has a range of -4 to 4, and configured in the same way as the semi-tone tuning object. The only difference here is that the <em>Unit Style</em> was set to <em>Custom</em> and ‘Oct’ was added as the unit.</p>

<h3 id="de-tune">De-tune</h3>

<p>As detune dials are normally in Hertz, the patch must be adjusted to allow the pitch manipulation to occur after the MIDI note has been conferted to a frequency via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mtof</code> object:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_18.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_18.png" alt="De-tune in Hz" /><em>De-tune in Hz</em></a></p>

<h3 id="alternative-method">Alternative Method</h3>

<p>The above method works fine for the octave and semitone manipulation, however there are a number of drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The change in tuning only takes place on a fresh note i.e the pitch change will never occur in the sustain stage of a key-press</li>
  <li>The de-tune amount in never in tune with the current note i.e. the amount of ‘drift’ is inconsistant musically; even though the amount of de-tuning is fixed, it is not exponential like the musical scale therefore at different octaves, the amount of ‘drift’ can be more or less.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternative method is to adjust the tuning in Hz, i.e add ‘n’ to the incoming notes in Hz to shift them up an octave or a 7th:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_19.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_19.png" alt="Fixed Tuning Example" /><em>Fixed Tuning Example</em></a></p>

<p>This way of tuning the MIDI note being being converted to Hz and then into a signal to be manipulated. It could be done while remaining a message, but moving into the signal realm allows the tuning to take place in real-time i.e there is no need to wait for a new note in order to hear the change in tuning.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">live.numbox</code> objects are for entering the amount of tuning in semi-tones and percents of a semi-tone.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">sig~</code> object converts the frequency from the message format (only transmits on change) into an audio signal (transmitted at audio rate).</p>

<p>The change of pitch occurs from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*~ 0.</code> object which is fed from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">expr</code> object. The function of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">expr</code> in this case is to convert a linear semitone value into a logarithmic range that works in Hz for the tuning.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">trigger</code> object here is used to retrigger the calculation <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code>.  More details on inlets and the trigger object can be found <a href="/fundamentals/#hot-and-cold-inlets">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="oscillator-waveforms">Oscillator Waveforms</h2>
<p>There are a range of pre-built oscillators that can be used as the sound-source for a synth.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/waveforms.png"><img src="/assets/img/waveforms.png" alt="Waveforms" /><em>Standard Waveforms</em></a></p>

<p>Use these in conjunction with the <a href="/routing/#selector--switch"><code class="highlighter-rouge">selector~</code></a> object to provide more sound design options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sinusoidal - <code class="highlighter-rouge">cycle~</code></li>
  <li>Sawtooth - <code class="highlighter-rouge">saw~</code></li>
  <li>Triangle - `tri~: pay attention to the <strong>Duty Cycle</strong>  argument.</li>
  <li>Square - <code class="highlighter-rouge">rect~</code>: pay attention to the <strong>Pulse Width</strong> argument.</li>
  <li>White Noise - <code class="highlighter-rouge">noise~</code></li>
  <li>Pink Noise - <code class="highlighter-rouge">pink~</code></li>
