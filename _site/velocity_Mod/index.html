<p>In addition to amplitude control, velocity is regularly utilised as a modulation source for other parameters such as filter frequency, resonance and so on. As an example to introduce more expressiveness into a synthesiser, velocity could be used to modulate the amount of saturation, or chorus that is applied to a sound according to how hard/fast a key has been pressed.</p>

<p>In this section, velocity will be used for filter frequency modulation but the theory and application is the same regardless of the parameters that it could be routed to.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="filter-envelope">Filter Envelope</h2>

<p>Filter envelopes work by taking a fixed value and modulating (changing that value over time). The shape of that modulation is dictated by an enveloped shape and the amount, or intensity, of the modulation is controlled by the velocity of the notes coming in. Commonly, there is an ‘envelope amount’ dial to further control how intense the modulation will be. The patch below shows an implementation of velocity modulation; the velocity modulation object additions have been highlighted in yellow.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_12_velMod.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_12_velMod.png" alt="Velocity Modulation" /><em>Velocity Modulation of Filter Frequency</em></a></p>

<p>Velocity values are being pulled from <code class="highlighter-rouge">ddg.mono</code> in the same way as for the amplitude modulation including being scaled between 0. and 1. by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ 127.</code> object. The key difference here is that the filter modulation should only be triggered by a NoteOn (&gt; 0 velocity) otherwise the filter envelope would be triggered twice for each key press (on and off).</p>

<p>Ideally, the filter envelope patch should simply ignore NoteOff velocities (0). This is achieved by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sel</code> object. When a value passes into this object, if the value is 0 (as per the argument in this patch) then a ‘bang’ is passed out of the left outlet. Any other values that do not match the argument (greater than 0 i.e NoteOn velocities) are passed through the right outlet - these are the NoteOn values for this patch that will be utilised.</p>

<h3 id="modulation-offsets">Modulation Offsets</h3>

<p>To acheive the modulation, the frequency control (<code class="highlighter-rouge">live.dial</code>) for the filter outputs a value that is being modulated (interfered with) by the output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> object. To achieve this modulation, the first thought may be to just multiply the output from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">live.dial</code> with the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> as follows:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_13.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_13.png" alt="Filter Envelope Mod A" /><em>Filter Envelope Mod At</em></a></p>

<p>The outcome of this method would be that the modulated frequency value going into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">svf</code> filter would start from 0 Hz and rise up to a maximum of 150Hz (depending on the velocity used).In the majority of instruments, the filter frequency chosen is usually the minimum value that will be output i.e from 150 Hz upwards and back. To acheive this there has to be an offset added ito the patch:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_14.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_monosynth_14.png" alt="Filter Envelope Mod B" /><em>Filter Envelope Mod B</em></a></p>

<p>Now, the filter frequency will still initially run from 0Hz minimum to 150Hz maximum, but after this modulation takes place, 150 is added to the values therefore offsetting the signal so that 150Hz is the starting point of the modulation now instead of 0Hz.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method of modulation always follows the same proceedure: (Parameter * Modulation) + Parameter</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="modulation-amount">Modulation Amount</h3>

<p>Even though this method of <strong>velocity &gt; envelope &gt; parameter</strong> modulation works, the modulation amount is directly related to the velocity; there is no method of attenuating or intensifying the effect. As the envelope is the driving force behind the filter frequency’s values (static or otherwise), it would make sense that being able to increase or decrease the range of the envelope would provide this level of control:</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="velocity-sensitivity">Velocity Sensitivity</h2>
<p>In addition to offering velocity sensitivity, many synths also provide control over how subtle or intense any velocity based modulation is.</p>

<p>The image below shows a very basic form of how this velocity sensitivity can be implemented:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_velSen_01.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_velSen_01.png" alt="Velocity Sensitivity Example 01" /><em>Velocity Sensitivity Example 01</em></a></p>

<p>The key object here is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scale</code> object which allows for the scaling of the range being passed further down the patch (in this case, to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> object).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">uzi</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">zl.group</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">multislider</code> objects are here to demonstrate the outcome of the patch. These can all be removed when implementing into an actual synth patch without affecting the function of velocity sensitivity method.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<p>The concept here is to gain control over the incoming velocity values. Consider three ‘levels’ of sensitivity:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sensitivity Level</th>
      <th>Outcome</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No sensitivity</td>
      <td>Outgoing velocity fixed regardless of incoming velocity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Normal sensitivity (linear)</td>
      <td>Outgoing velocity = incoming velocity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Exaggerated sensitivity (exponential)</td>
      <td>Velocity is not mapped linearly against the incoming</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="no-sensitivity">No Sensitivity</h3>
<p>In the patch above, to create a ‘no sensitivity’ scaling, simply set the <strong>Min Vel Out</strong> and <strong>Max Vel Out</strong> to the same value i.e <strong>64</strong> and press the <code class="highlighter-rouge">button</code> object. Look at the graph will show how the input and output are mapped</p>

<h3 id="linear-sensitivity">Linear Sensitivity</h3>
<p>For ‘normal sensitivity’, set the <strong>Min Vel Out</strong> to ‘<strong>0</strong>’ and the <strong>Max Vel Out</strong> to ‘<strong>127</strong>’. Press the <code class="highlighter-rouge">button</code> object again and observe the graph.</p>

<h3 id="non-linear">Non-Linear</h3>
<p>The final inlet of <code class="highlighter-rouge">scale</code> is being used to add a concave, or convex, curve to the previously linear mapping. The <strong>@classic 0</strong> argument, provides control over that curve, <strong>1</strong> being linear, <strong>&lt; 0</strong> logarithmic and <strong>&gt; 1</strong> exponential.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h3>

<p>While this patch demonstrates the manipulation of the incoming velocities via the graph at the bottom, it will cause problems if the <strong>Min Vel Out</strong> is raised above 0, or the curve is set to 0. By raising the <strong>Min Vel Out</strong> the patch will lose the 0 velocity value required to ‘end’ a note. To get around this, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sel 0</code> can be implemented:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/aasp_velSen_02.png"><img src="/assets/img/aasp_velSen_02.png" alt="Velocity Sensitivity Example 02" /><em>Velocity Sensitivity Example 02</em></a></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">sel 0</code> object basically routes all values that are not 0 out of the right outlet (and this into the scaling section in this patch). If a 0 is received by <code class="highlighter-rouge">sel 0</code> then a ‘bang’ is sent from the left outlet of <code class="highlighter-rouge">sel</code>. In this patch, that ‘bang’ leads to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">t 0</code> object which will then trigger a ‘0’ message that is unscaled. When being implemented in a synth, the scaled velocities and the ‘0’ messages would be connected to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">adsr~</code> object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effects of this curvature are easily heard when applied to the modulation of a filter’s frequency via a velocity sensitive envelope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="further-research">Further Research</h2>
<p>Look into existing synths (hardware or software) for examples of where, and how, velocity can be utilised.</p>

<p>Additionally, consider how the MIDI notes themselves can be utilised as a similar modulation source.</p>
